LumiLantern – Interactive Light Prototype
Introduction
LumiLantern is an interactive light prototype inspired by traditional Chinese lanterns. The concept was developed with the idea of integrating cultural heritage with modern UX, interactivity, and fabrication techniques.

The project takes inspiration from the Lunar New Year, where lanterns symbolize hope, reunion, and celebration. The goal is to create a user-controlled light experience where the light behavior changes based on physical interactions such as folding, pressing, and twisting.

State Diagram
The LumiLantern prototype features three primary states, each activated by different user interactions. The state transitions are determined by the pressure and movement applied to the lantern.

Interactive Behaviors
Default State (Closed) – Off (No Light): Lantern remains folded, and no power is supplied to the LED strip.
Press / Squeeze – Warm Glow (Yellow/Orange): A slight press activates the copper tape circuit, turning the light to a warm glow.
Twist / Slightly Unfold – Dynamic Color Gradient: As the lantern unfolds slightly, the LED transitions into a dynamic gradient color mode.
Fully Open – Slow Pulsing White Light: Expanding the lantern fully enables a slow pulsing white light, symbolizing a traditional glowing lantern.

Hardware
The following components were used in the LumiLantern prototype:

RGB LED Strip – Provides color-changing illumination.
ESP32 Microcontroller – Controls the LED lighting behavior.
Copper Tape – Used as capacitive touch sensors to detect user interaction.
Resistors – Used to regulate electrical flow.
Paper / Thin Acrylic – Forms the physical structure of the lantern.
